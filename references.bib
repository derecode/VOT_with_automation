	abstract = {‘Autonomous cars’ are cars that can drive themselves without human control. Autonomous cars can safely drive closer together than cars driven by humans, thereby possibly increasing road capacity. By allowing drivers to perform other activities in the vehicle, they may reduce the value of travel time losses (VOT). We investigate the effects of autonomous cars using a dynamic equilibrium model of congestion that captures three main elements: the resulting increase in capacity, the decrease in the VOT for those who acquire one and the implications of the resulting changes in the heterogeneity of VOTs. We do so for three market organizations: private monopoly, perfect competition and public supply. Even though an increased share of autonomous cars raises average capacity, it may hurt existing autonomous car users as those who switch to an autonomous car will impose increased congestion externalities due to their altered departure time behaviour. Depending on which effect dominates, switching to an autonomous vehicle may impose a net negative or positive externality. Often public supply leads to 100\% autonomous cars, but it may be optimal to have a mix of car types, especially when there is a net negative externality. With a positive (negative) externality, perfect competition leads to an undersupply (oversupply) of autonomous cars, and a public supplier needs to subsidise (tax) autonomous cars to maximise welfare. A monopolist supplier ignores the capacity effect and adds a mark-up to its price.},

	abstract = {In current transport appraisal practices, travel time is considered as wasted time, representing a disutility. Based on the view that unproductive travel time saved can be converted into productive use, business travel time is traditionally valued at labour costs. There is, however, increasing evidence that travel time is not always wasted. People often report positive utilities due to activities that can be conducted whilst travelling, for example, checking work emails or carrying out leisure activities such as reading.},

	abstract = {This paper looks at the roles of technologies and other factors in lifestyle choices, travel patterns and behaviours. Building on earlier Roundtable reports on value of time, it discusses how recent behavioural changes might affect the disutility of time spent travelling relative to time spent on other activities. The paper concludes with a discussion on the implications for policy practitioners around modelling and assessing value of travel time savings.},
